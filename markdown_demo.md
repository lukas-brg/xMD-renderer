## Lists

**Unordered**

```
+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

```

    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

**Ordered**

```
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`
```

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

```
3. foo
    1. baz
    2. test
1. bar

```


3.  foo
    1. baz
    2. test
1. bar

**Unordered and ordered lists can also be mixed:**

  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

## Code

### Inline Code

```
Inline `code`
```

### Indented code blocks



```
Every line that is indented by 4 spaces or more will be displayed as a code block. The lines of code will keep their relative indentation.

    This is a line of code
      This is another line of code

This is normal text.

### Block code "fences"




    ```
    Sample text here...
    ```


```

#### Syntax highlighting

Specify the language after the code block opening fences, 'auto' is also accepted.


    ```js
    var foo = function (bar) {
      return bar++;
    };
    ```


```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

The exact width of the columns does not need to be consistent, only the number of columns does.

### Linking to Headings

You can create links to headings within this document using the following rules:

- Remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the heading text.
- Replace single and consecutive spaces with one dash `-`.
- Convert the text to all-lowercase.

If duplicate headings exist and you want to link to them, append `-[COUNT]` to the end of the link, where `COUNT=1` refers to the first duplicate.


```
[Link to first H1 Heading](#h1-heading)

[Link to second H1 Heading](#h1-heading-1)

[Link to this section's heading](#linking-to-headings)
```


[Link to first H1 Heading](#h1-heading)

[Link to second H1 Heading](#h1-heading-1)

[Link to this section's heading](#linking-to-headings)

### Custom IDs

```
#### Headings can have a custom ID {#custom_id}

The custom ID can be used to [Link](#custom_id) to the heading.

```

#### Headings can have a custom ID {#custom_id}

The custom ID can be used to [Link](#custom_id) to the heading.

## Footnotes


```
Footnote 1 link[^first].

Footnote 2 link[^second].
```

Footnote 1 link[^first].

Footnote 2 link[^second].


The corresponding footnotes look like this:


```
[^first]: Footnotes _can have markup_

    and multiple paragraphs.

[^second]: Footnote text.
```

```
Footnotes are enumerated by their order in the document, regardless of their text[^1].

[^1]: The footnotes can be split up across the document
    Though they are always displayed at the bottom

## Latex Equations

### Inline Equations

```
Inline latex equation $\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon\$

Another inline equation $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}$

```

Another inline equation $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}$


### Block Equations

```
$$\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}$$

$$\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} \, dz = f(z_0) \cdot \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{z_0 - a_n}$$

$$
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 &= 1 \\
y &= \sqrt{1 - x^2} \\
y &= 0
\end{align*}
$$

``` 


$$\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}$$



$$\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} \, dz = f(z_0) \cdot \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{z_0 - a_n}$$


$$
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 &= 1 \\
y &= \sqrt{1 - x^2} \\
\end{align*}
$$

### Escaping Latex Syntax

If the Latex Syntax conflicts with something you want to be displayed, you can use backslashes to escape the `$`.
**Note:** Within code elements Latex equations won't be rendered anyway, so you can use the `$` character safely there.



```
\$\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon\$

\$\$\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} \, dz = f(z_0) \cdot \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{z_0 - a_n}\$\$
```

**This should not be rendered as an equation:**

\$\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon\$

\$\$\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} \, dz = f(z_0) \cdot \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{z_0 - a_n}\$\$


# h1 Heading

This heading's purpose is to test whether the links in the table of contents still work with duplicate headings and to demonstrate how linking to duplicate headings works.
